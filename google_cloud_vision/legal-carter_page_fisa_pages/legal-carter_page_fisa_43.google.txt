The authorities requested should not automatically terminate when foreign
intelligence information has first been obtained. Additional information of the same
type will be obtained on a continuous basis throughout the entire period requested.
The activities which the IInited States must identify and monitor are incremental
and continuous, and communications relating to such activities are often disguised

given time, all such information has been obtained and collection can be ended.
Accordingly, the United States requests the authorities specified herein for a period
of ninety (90) days
