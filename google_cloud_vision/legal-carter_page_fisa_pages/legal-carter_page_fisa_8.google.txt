As stated in the legislative history of FISA:
Not only do foreign powers engage in spying in the United States to
obtain information, they also engage in activities which are intended to
harm the Nation's security by affecting the course of our Government, the
course of public opinion, or the activities of individuals. Such activities
may include political action (recruiting, bribery or influencing of public
officials to act in favor or the foreign power), disguised propaganda
(including the planting of false or misleading articles or stories), and
harassment, intimidation, or even assassination of individuals who
oppose the foreign power. Such activity can undermine our democratic
institutions as well as directly threaten the peace and safety of our
citizens.
