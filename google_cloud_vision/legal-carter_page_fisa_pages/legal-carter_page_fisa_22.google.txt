published an article (September 23rd News Article), which was written by the news
organization's Chief Investigative Correspondent, alleging that U.S. intelligence
officials are investigating Page with respect to suspected efforts by the Russian
Government to influence the U.S. Presidential election. According to the September

Moscow in July 2016 to deliver the above-noted commencement address at the New
Economic School, he met with two senior Russian officials. The September 23rd
News Article stated that a "well-placed Western intelligence source" told the news
organization that Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former
Russian deputy minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft. At their
alleged meeting, Sechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with Page.
