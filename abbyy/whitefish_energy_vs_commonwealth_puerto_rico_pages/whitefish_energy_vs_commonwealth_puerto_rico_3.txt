 Document Page 3 of 9                                                                                              
 segments assigned by PREPA to WEH, which constitutes part of the backbone of the transmission                     
 system in the area. (See chart2 attached hereto as Exhibit A).                                                    
                                                                                                                   
 7.    Todd W. Filsingcr of Filsingcr was appointed PREPA’s Chief Financial Officer on                             
 December I, 2017. As part of his appointment, he uses the services of other professionals at                      
 Filsingcr to perfonn his tasks, upon approval of PREPA’s governing board.                                         
 8.    WEH has submitted invoices to PREPA for work performed and for mobilization                                 
 and demobilization costs totaling approximately S141 million. To-date, WEH and its                                
                                                                                                                   
 subcontractors are still owed over SI00 million.                                                                  
 9.    WEH has provided all of the documentation requested by PREPA in order to                                    
 prepare Project Worksheets and other necessary documentation to request reimbursement and/or                      
 payment of WEH’s invoices from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA”).                                  
 However it has been over five (5) months since the termination of the WEH Contract, and PREPA                     
 and its professionals have still not submitted that documentation to FEMA.                                        
 10.    It is now nppurent from the Fee Application that Filsingcr is not devoting the                             
                                                                                                                   
 resources that arc even minimally necessary to complete the FEMA submission of WEH’s                              
 invoices, which in turn will represent a reimbursement to PREPA; this is not in the best interests                
                                                                                                                   
 of the estate and its creditors.                                                                                  
 11.    Even though WEH was the first on the island to begin repairs to Puerto Rico’s                              
 transmission and distribution lines, PREPA’s professionals have not dedicated the necessary time                  
 and resources to prepare the documentation required to seek FEMA reimbursement for WEH’s                          
 work. Yet PREPA submitted the necessary documentation for PREPA’s other contractor. Cobra                         
 Acquisitions, LLC (“Cobra”), leading to FEMA’s approval of that contract in December 2017.
