an October 7, 2016 Joint Statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security (Election Security Joint
Statement), the USIC is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent
compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S.
political organizations. The Election Security Joint Statement states that the recent
disclosures of e-mails on, among others, sites like WikiLeaks are consistent with the
methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. According to the Election
Security Joint Statement, these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with
the U.S. election process; activity that is not new to Moscow - the Russians have
used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to
influence public opinion there. The Election Security Joint Statement states that,
based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, only Russia's senior-most officials
could have authorized these activities.
