# Adobe Acrobat Pro DC

Adobe Acrobat Pro DC can process multiple documents at once, but it isn't available as an API or command line document.

To [batch process documents](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2500144), we selected "Recognize Text > In multiple files..." and used the dialog to tell Adobe where to store output files.
