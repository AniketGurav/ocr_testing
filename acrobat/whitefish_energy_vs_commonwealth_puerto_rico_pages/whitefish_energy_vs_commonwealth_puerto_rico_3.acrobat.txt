Todd W. Filsinger of Filsinger wus appoinled PREP A's Chief Financia l Officer on

Dece,nber I, 2017. As pa11 of his appoinltnent, he uses the services of 01her professionals at

prepare Project Worksheets and other necessary docmncntalion to requesl reimbursement and/o r
pay1nenl of WEH's invoices from lhe Federal E1nergency Manage,nenl Agency ("FEMA").
However it has been over five (5) months since the tennination of the WEH Conlracl, and PREP A
and its professionals have still no l submitted that docmnentation to FEMA .
10.

II is now appnre nl front lhc Fee Application thal Filsinger is nol devoting the

resources that are even minimally necessary to complete the FEMA submiss ion of WEH's
invoices, which in turn will repres ent n reimburs ement to PR EPA; this is not in the best interests
of the estate and its creditors.
11.

Even though \VEH was the first on the island to begin repairs to Pue,10 Rico's

trnnsmission and distribution lines , PREP A's professionals have nol dedicated the necessary time
and resources to prepare the docu,nentation required to seek FEMA rci111burse1ncnt for Wt\ll's
work. Yel PREPA submilled the necessary documentatio n for PREPA's other contractor, Cobra
Acquisitions, LLC ("Co bra"), leadi ng to l'EM A 's approval of that contrnct in December 2017.
