On May 3, 2017, the Financial Overs ight and Management Board for Puer to Rico

(the "Oversight Board") filed a voluntary petition for relief pursuant to PROMESA section 304(a}
(the "Title Ill Case"). Following this, the Oversight Board filed Title Ill cases for various enti ties,
including the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority ("PREPA") on July 2, 2017.

On Septe1nber 26, 20 17, after Puerto Rico was struck by two hurricanes, which

severe ly damaged its elect ric grid, PREP A entered into a contract with WEH for the repair of the
electrical systent's "backbone" of approxima tely 200 miles oft ransn1ission lines and towers, many
of which were located in the 1nountains of Pue110Rico's rugged interior (the "WEH Contract") .
PREPA understood , that the WEH teain had the necessary experie nce to repair the 230kV
trans1nission lines in remote areas with no access roads.

e1nployees and subcontrac tors on the Island, perfonning repairs.
