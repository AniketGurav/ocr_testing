Specifically,Cobra reported, "FEMA reviewed our original contract with PREPA and our rates of
service. In a letter dated Decclllber23, 2017, FEMA determined that PREPA awardedour contract
in co,npliance with emergency procurement provisions of the Conunonwealth of Puerto Rico and
ExecutiveOrders issued as a result of the disaster,and also deterlllinedthe costs under the contract
to be reasonable.")
12.

If PREPA also obtains silllilar approval from FEMA for WEH's contract, then not

only will PREPA be able to pay WEH the over $1OOM currently owed to WEH thereby eliminating
one of PREPA's largest administrative claims, but PREPA also will be able to restore to its
EntergencyFund the $36.9 million that PREPA previously paid WEH.
13.

WEH's counsel has attempted to work with PREPA and its professionals,including

Filsinger, to ensure the tin1ely preparationof the docmnents required by FEMA. Sublllissionof
this documentationand pay1nentby FEMA for WEI-l's emergency repair work will greatlybenefit
the estate in two ways: (I) PREPA will receive reimbursementoft he$ 36.9 million it has already
paid WEH, which will increase its liquidity;and (2) PREPA can pay the outstanding invoices to
\VEH, which will reduce dollar-for-dollar the a1nount of WEH's significant administrative claim
against PREPA, which will inure to the benefit of all unsecured creditors. However, PREPA and
its professionals, including Filsinger,have refused to dedicate the necessary resources to prepare
the documentation required for FEMA's approval of WEH's invoices, and have not been
forthcomingwith WEH as to the ti1nelinefor such submission.
14.

On March 20, 20 I8, Filsinger filed its Fee Application,seeking $2,326,893.30 in

fees and S,201,691.48in expenses for the period from December 17, 2017 through January 3 1,
2018 (the "Application Period"). There are 24 pages of time detail included in the Fee Ai>plication.
