Candidate #l's campaign worked behind the scenes to make sure Political Party #l's
platform would not call for giving weapons to Ukraine to fight Russian and rebel
forces, contradicting the view of almost all Political Party #l's foreign policy leaders in Washington. The article stated that Candidate It's campaign sought "to make
su re that [Political Party #1Jwould not pledge to give Ukraine the weapons it has
been ask ing for from the United States." Further, an August 2016 article pu blished

by an identified news organization characterized Candidate 11 as sounding like a
supporter of Ukraine's territorial integrity in September [2015], adopted a "milder"
tone regarding Russia' s annexati on of Crimea . The Augus t 2016 article furthe r
reported that Candidate #1 said Candidate #1 might recognize Crimea as Russian
territory and lift punitive U.S. sanctions against Russia. The article opined that
while the reason for Candidate #l's shift was not clear, Candidate #l's more
conciliatory words, which contradict Political Party #l's official platform, follow
Candidate #l's recent association with several people sympathetic to Russian
influence in Ukraine, including foreign policy advisor Carter Page.
