Specifically, Cobra reported, ' 'FEMA reviewed our original contract with PREPA and our rates Of
service. In a letter dated December 23, 2017, FEMA determined that PREPA awarded our contract

Executive Orders issued as a result of the disaster, and also determined the costs under the contract
to be reasonable."3
If PREPA also obtains similar approval from FEMA for WEH's contract, then not

one of PREPA's largest administrative claims, but PREPA also will be able to restore to its
Emergency Fund the $36.9 million that PREPA previously paid WEH.
13. WEH's counsel has attempted to work with PREPA and its professionals, including
Filsinger, to ensuie the timely preparation of the documents required by FEMA. Submission of
this documentation and payment by FEMA for WEH's emergency repair work will greatly benefit
the estate in two ways: (l) PREPA will receive reimbursement of the $36.9 million it has already
paid WEH, which will increase its liquidity; and (2) PREPA can pay the outstanding invoices to
WEH, which will reduce dollar-for-dollar the amount of W EH's significant administrative claim
against PREPA, which will inure to the benefit Of all unsecured creditors. However, PREPA and
its professionals, including Filsinger, have reftsed to dedicate the necessary to prepare
the documentation required for FEMA's apploval Of WEWs invoices, and have not been
forthcoming with WEH as to the timeline for such submission.
