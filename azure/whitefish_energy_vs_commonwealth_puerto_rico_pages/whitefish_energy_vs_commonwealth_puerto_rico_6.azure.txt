a course of action which is to the detriment of the estate and the creditors, preventing PREPA
from obtaining reimbursement of S36.9 million which it could use for any one of the pressing
financial issues it has detailed to this Court. Furthermore, if WEH is not paid by PREPA with
FEMA funds, then it will be forced to file an administrative claim against the PREPA estate, which
would have to be paid in full upon confirmation Ofa Plan Of Adjustment, and would be paid before
general unsecured creditors. Submission of the WEH invoices to FEMA will eliminate this SIOO+
million plus claim from the PREPA estate, and should be done timely.
18. WEH requests that this Court hold the Fee Application in abeyance and order that
no amounts be disbursed to Filsinger until PREPA has provided WEH with a certification
regarding (i) a timeline for its preparation of the necessary FEMA documentation for WEH's
invoices; (ii) a commitment to dedicate the necessary resources at PREPA, Filsinger, and other
professionals to complete the FEMA submission process for WEE-I's invoices; (iii) a
communication plan to ensure transparency with WEH regarding the FEMA submission process;
and (iv) a deadline for PREPA's submission of the necessary documentation to FEMA for the
reimbursement and/or payment of WEH's invoices (the "Certification").
19. While WEWs request is somewhat unusual, WEH has been unable to mesolve this
issue with PREPA and its professionals Over the last several months, despite WEH's submission
of all information sought by PREPA and its professionals needed to submit the request to FEMA,
and its repeated commitments to assist in any way it can with the FEMA submissions. WEH
believes that this remedy will help expedite the process of having WEH's invoices submitted for
reimbursement and/or payment by FEMA, which will benefit all of the parties in this case.
CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, WEH respectfully requests that this Court (l)
hold in abeyance the application by Filsinger, (2) order that none Of the fees sought in the Fee
