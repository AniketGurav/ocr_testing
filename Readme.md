* Lindsay will check w/Ryan on embedding
* Intro needs more. Sections like:

# Welcome

This repository contains the scripts and outputs from our OCR comparison tests.

We identified a few sample documents to run through OCR systems so we could compare the results. The documents we used in our final write up are these:

+ A receipt -- This receipt from the Riker's commissary was included in States of Incarceration, a collaborative storytelling project and traveling exhibition about incarceration in America.
+ A heavily redacted document -- Carter Page's FISA warrant is a legal filing with a lot of redacted portions, just the kind of exasperating thing reporters deal with all the time.
+ Something historical -- Executive Order 9066 authorized the internment of Japanese Americans in 1942. The scanned image available in the national archives is fairly high quality but it is still an old, typewritten document.
+ A form -- This Texas campaign finance report, from a Texas Tribune story about abuses in the juvenile justice system has very clean text but the formatting is important to understanding the document.
+ Something wrinkled --  in early 2014 a group of divers retrieved hundreds of pages of documents from a lake at Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's vast country estate. The former president or his staff had dumped the records there in the hopes of destroying them, but many pages were still at least somewhat legible. Reporters laid them out to dry and began the process of transcribing the waterlogged papers. We selected a page that is more or less readable to the human eye but definitely warped with water damage.

We also tested the OCR engines against a handful of alternative documents, for no particular reason. (more TK)
