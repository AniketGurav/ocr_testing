10. @ i ities Requested (See also,

The authorities requested should not automatically terminate when foreign

 

intelligence information has first been obtained. Additional information of the same
type will be obtained on a continuous basis throughout the entire period requested.
The activities which the United States mnst identify and monitor are incremental
and continuous, and communications relating to such activities are often disguised
to appear innocuous. The type of foreign intelligence information being sought and
the fact that the activities of this target are ongoing preclude the conclusion that, ata
given time, all such information has been obtained and collection can be ended.
Accordingly, the United States requests the authorities specified herein for a period

of ninety (90) days.
