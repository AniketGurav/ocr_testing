I. (U) @HXE) RIS Efforts to Influence U.S. Presidential Elections.

(SXMR) During a recent interview with an identified news organization, the
Director of National Intelligence (DNI) stated, “Russia has tried to influence U.S.
elections since the 1960s during the Cold War” and “there's a tradition in Russia of
interfering with elections, their own and others.” The DNI commented that this
influence included providing money to particular candidates or providing
disinformation. The DNI added that “it shouldn’t come as a big shock to people,

I think it’s more dramatic maybe because they have the cyber tools that they can.

bring to bear in the same effort.”
