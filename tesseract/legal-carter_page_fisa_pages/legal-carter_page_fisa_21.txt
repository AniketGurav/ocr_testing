FHS EEE OLDEN,

Candidate #1’s campaign worked behind the scenes to make sure Political Party #1’s
platform would not call for giving weapons to Ukraine to fight Russian and rebel
forces, contradicting the view of almost all Political Party #1’s foreign policy leaders
in Washington. The article stated that Candidate #1’s campaign sought “to make
sure that [Political Party #1] would not pledge to give Ukraine the weapons it has
been asking for from the United States.” Further, an August 2016 article published
by an identified news organization characterized Candidate #1 as sounding like a
supporter of Ukraine's territorial integrity in September [2015], adopted a “milder”
tone regarding Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The August 2016 article further
reported that Candidate #1 said Candidate #1 might recognize Crimea as Russian
territory and lift punitive USS. sanctions against Russia. The article opined that
while the reason for Candidate #1’s shift was not clear, Candidate #1’s more
conciliatory words, which contradict Political Party #1’s official platform, follow

Candidate #1’s recent association with several people sympathetic to Russian

influence in Ukraine, including foreign policy advisor Carter Page. | bia
